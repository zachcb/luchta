# Agent Guidelines for Luchta

This document provides conventions and guidelines for AI coding agents working on the Luchta project.

## Project Tracking
- This project uses **GitHub Issues** as its primary tracker.

## Project Structure
Luchta is a Cargo workspace with the following crate layout:
- `crates/luchta-types`: Core data structures and types.
- `crates/luchta-lockfiles`: Lockfile parsing and abstraction.
- `crates/luchta-workspace`: Workspace and package discovery.
- `crates/luchta-engine`: Graph logic and execution engine.
- `crates/luchta-cli`: CLI interface and configuration.
- `crates/luchta-cache`: Filesystem-backed build cache, hashing, and skip logic (`thiserror`, filesystem records, no embedded DB).
- `crates/luchta-sessions`: Per-worktree dev sessions — port plans, the lock-based machine-wide session registry, and slot allocation behind `luchta session` / `luchta sessions` (`thiserror`).
- `crates/luchta-yarn-env`: Computes the environment Yarn Berry injects when running a script (bin shims, `NODE_OPTIONS`, `npm_*`) from the PnP manifest via the `pnp` crate; `luchta-yarn-worker` uses it for direct execution. Its `test-fixture` feature exposes `PnpFixture`, a synthetic PnP project builder for other crates' tests.
- `xtask`: Project automation crate (standard Rust `xtask` pattern), run via the `cargo xtask` alias.

## Key Architectural Decisions
Agents must respect these fundamental design choices:
- **Runtime:** Uses `tokio` for async I/O-bound process spawning. **Rayon is explicitly excluded.**
- **Concurrency Model:** Implements **weight-based concurrency** using `tokio::sync::Semaphore::acquire_many_owned(weight)`.
- **Graph Logic:** Uses `petgraph::DiGraph` and `petgraph::algo::toposort` for cycle detection.
- **Dual-Graph Separation:** Maintains separate **Package Graph** (package topology) and **Task Graph** (task execution units).
- **Lockfile Abstraction:** All lockfile interactions must go through the `Lockfile` trait.
- **Error Handling:**
    - Use `thiserror` for library crates (`luchta-types`, `luchta-lockfiles`, `luchta-workspace`, `luchta-engine`).
    - Use `miette` only in the `luchta-cli` for user-facing diagnostics.
- **Configuration:** Primary configuration is an executable `luchta-config.*` script at the workspace root that prints a JSON configuration object to `stdout`.

## Validation Commands
You MUST run the full verification pipeline before committing. Do not skip any
step or you WILL miss problems.

```bash
cargo build --workspace                                  # Compile the whole workspace
cargo fmt --all                                          # Auto-format (rustup uses rust-toolchain.toml — matches CI)
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings    # Lint — treat warnings as errors
cargo nextest run --workspace                            # Run all tests via nextest
cargo nextest run --workspace --stress-count=5           # Repeat 5x to catch flaky tests
cs delta origin/HEAD                                     # CodeScene quality analysis of branch changes
cargo xtask install                                      # Install all workspace binary crates locally
cargo xtask build-worker --target <triple>                  # Build the Go-based TypeScript worker
```

**CodeScene must be all green.** `cs delta` must report no new code-health
problems (no degrading functions, no new code smells) before the work is
considered done. A red or degrading CodeScene result is a blocker — fix the
flagged code, do not merge around it.

**Do not ignore clippy warnings.** Treat every warning as an error; CI runs
`cargo clippy -- -D warnings`.

If `cargo nextest` is not installed: `cargo install cargo-nextest --locked`
(or `cargo binstall cargo-nextest`). The `--stress-count=5` run repeats the
suite five times — flaky tests that pass once but fail intermittently surface
here.

The process-spawning end-to-end tests (`luchta-worker-watcher::e2e`,
`luchta-cli`'s `worker_integration` and `driver_e2e_tests`) spawn real
processes and wait on filesystem events against a roughly 10s deadline. Under
full CPU-count concurrency that contention can push one past the deadline and
fail as a bare timeout. They run in the throttled `watch-e2e` test group
(`max-threads = 4`) defined in `.config/nextest.toml`, so the rest of the
suite keeps full parallelism. If you hit a bare timeout there, re-run the test
in isolation (it finishes in well under a second): a clean isolated pass points
to load-dependent flakiness (contention, or a concurrency/timing bug that only
surfaces under parallelism) rather than logic that's broken every run, so
reproduce under full-workspace stress before blaming — or clearing — a code
change. Raising `fs.inotify.max_user_instances` above the common default of 128
is a reasonable dev-machine tweak but is not the cause of these timeouts.

**`cargo nextest run --workspace` is the canonical test command.** Do not use
plain `cargo test` — it runs the whole suite in one process with shared
threads, so tests that mutate process-global state (cwd, real environment
variables, temp dirs coupled to cwd) race and fail nondeterministically.
Nextest runs each test in its own process, isolating that state. Such tests
call `require_nextest()` (from the `luchta-test-support` crate) as their first
line; when run under `cargo test` they panic with guidance instead of failing
spuriously. When adding a test that mutates process-global state, call
`require_nextest()` first and add `luchta-test-support` as a `[dev-dependency]`.

Tests that need a real Yarn PnP project (anything exercising `luchta-yarn-worker`
without `--no-direct`) build one with `luchta_yarn_env::test_fixture::PnpFixture`
(dev-dependency on `luchta-yarn-env` with the `test-fixture` feature) instead of
hand-writing `package.json` files; `FixtureOptions` switches between inline and
split manifests and toggles the ESM loader. `luchta run` prints a task's stdout
only when the task fails, so to assert what a script printed, give the task
`cache: {}` and read it back with `luchta logs` (see
`crates/luchta-cli/tests/yarn_direct_e2e.rs`).

Nextest runs every test through the repository's hermetic environment wrapper
in `.config/nextest.toml`. Host environment variables are removed unless they
are runtime essentials, Cargo/nextest metadata, rustup's toolchain selection
(`RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN`, `RUSTUP_HOME`), dynamic-loader or coverage settings, or
the explicit `LUCHTA_TEST_RCLONE` opt-in. The rustup variables matter because
some CLI tests build worker binaries with `escargot`: without them the `rustc`
proxy obeys a `rust-toolchain.toml` shipped inside a dependency's registry
source (the `pnp` crate pins an older release) and the build fails on CI. When a test suite needs
a new ambient customization, add its exact variable to both wrapper scripts'
allowlists and cover that behavior with a test; do not allow all `LUCHTA_*`
variables through.

## Conventions
- **No `target/`:** Never commit `target/` directories.
- **Error Types:** Library errors should be clear and descriptive using `thiserror`.
- **Async Traits:** Use native stable `async fn` in traits where possible (refer to `luchta-engine` for specific patterns).
- **Worker reports**: Workers can attach reports via the `report` JSONL message. These are stored verbatim in the task cache and can be retrieved raw via `luchta logs --file <NAME>`. Native pretty-printing in `luchta logs` supports `application/sarif+json` and `application/vnd.ctrf+json` (dispatch by MIME type).

## Changeset Files

When making a user-visible change, add a changeset file under `.changeset/`. The
YAML front matter specifies the version bump level, which Knope maps to
`CHANGELOG.md` sections:
- `patch` → **Fixes**
- `minor` → **Features**
- `major` → **Breaking Changes**

The key **must** be `luchta` — the whole workspace shares one version
(`version.workspace = true`), so individual crate names are not valid keys and
will cause `knope release` to error.

### Examples

**Simple:**
```markdown
---
luchta: patch
---
Fix oxfmt output truncation when buffer is full.
```

**Multi-line:**
```markdown
---
luchta: minor
---
# Support for custom build targets

Allow users to specify `--target` in the configuration file.
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use a single `#` for headers. Knope re-levels them automatically. Do **not**
> use `####` as it produces mis-leveled output.

The filename should be a short kebab-case slug, e.g.
`.changeset/add-blake3-caching.md`.

## Releasing

Releases are cut by [knope](https://knope.tech/) (config in `knope.toml`),
driven entirely from changeset files. The flow:

1. Land changes on `main`, each with a changeset describing the bump.
2. Trigger the **Prepare Release** GitHub Action (Actions -> Prepare Release ->
   Run workflow), or run `knope release` locally. This bumps the version in
   `Cargo.toml`, aggregates changesets into `CHANGELOG.md`, refreshes
   `Cargo.lock`, commits, and pushes a `luchta/v<version>` tag.
3. The tag push triggers the **Release** workflow
   (`.github/workflows/release.yaml`), which cross-builds platform binaries and
   uploads them to the GitHub Release.

To build a release on demand without cutting a version, run the **Release**
workflow manually (`workflow_dispatch`) — it builds the binaries and uploads
them as workflow artifacts instead of publishing a release.

## Dependency Updates & Auto-merge

- **Renovate** (`renovate.json`) opens PRs for dependency and GitHub Actions
  updates. Minor/patch/digest/pin updates (including non-major Actions bumps)
  are flagged for automerge; major updates require manual review.
- **Mergify** (`.mergify.yml`) runs a squash merge queue named `main`. It
  auto-queues passing Renovate PRs and any PR labeled `automerge`. A batch only
  merges once every CI check is green. The `Check` job runs as a per-OS matrix
  (ubuntu/windows/macos, and also runs clippy), producing `Check (<os>)`
  check-runs; alongside `Test` and `Format` (the job names in
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`). If you rename or add a CI job, update the
  `merge_conditions` in `.mergify.yml` to match.
